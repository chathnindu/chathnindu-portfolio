# chathnindu-portfolio 👾

> *A digital artifact from a timeline where 1991 never ended.*

This is a personal portfolio built with nostalgia, questioned design choices, and a lot of ☕.  
It serves as a playground for my projects and a tribute to the golden age of the web.

## What's inside? 📦

- **Starfield Background**: Powered by `Three.js` (because space is cool).
- **Retro Terminal**: A `guestbook.exe` that doesn't actually execute anything dangerous.
- **Glitch Effects**: CSS magic to make you question your monitor's health.
- **No Frameworks**: Okay, maybe Tailwind CSS. But mostly Vanilla JS. We keep it raw here.

## How to Run 🚀

1. Clone the repo (or just download it, I won't judge).
2. Open `portfolio/index.html` in your favorite browser.
   - *Best viewed in Netscape Navigator 3.0 (just kidding, use Chrome or Firefox)*.
3. Enjoy the vibes.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **HTML5** (Structural integrity)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Because writing CSS in 2024 is hard)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (For that authentic chaos)
- **Three.js** (For the stars ✨)

## License 📜

MIT. Do whatever you want with it. Just don't blame me if it becomes sentient.
